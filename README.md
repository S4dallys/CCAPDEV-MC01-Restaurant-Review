# CCAPDEV-MC01-Restaurant-Review
A repo for a restaurant review site.  

Link to GH repo: https://github.com/S4dallys/CCAPDEV-MCO1-Restaurant-Review

Contains 3 pieces of sample data for users and restaurants, as well as multiple sample reviews. Placeholder users/reviews/reastaurants are purely to show off scrolling/what the site would look like if it were fully populated.
  
All users and restaurants have their own page and are viewable. This sample site is from the view of Bob123. For this reason, only his account is able to be logged into/edited.














The best restaurants in Edgeville have 1991 in their name!
